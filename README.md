## Project Overview

***[Nakamoto Plaza](https://nakamoto-plaza.herokuapp.com/)*** is a clone of coinbase.com, an app that focuses on helping users buy, sell, send, and receive cryptocurrencies. Users see recent coin price and coin information, and simulate buying, selling, sending, or receiving coins to fictional wallets. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The goal of this week and a half long, full-stack project was to have 4 fully functional core MVP features finished, which include:  
- User accounts- Users can signup for accounts and simulated vaults and login/logout
- Coins- Users can see current and historical coin data in tables and charts, including holding data 
- Transactions- Users can 'buy' and 'sell' coins at current market prices which is recorded, and updates their vaults
- Transfers - allow users the ability to send and receive 'coins' to other users accounts
